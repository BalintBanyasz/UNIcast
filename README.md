UNIcast
=======

An open-source screen sharing and recording system designed to support computer-based seminars in higher education. The project utilizes the [Blackmagic Design H.264 Pro Recorder](http://www.blackmagicdesign.com/products/h264prorecorder) as a hardware encoder and multicast technology to achieve simultaneous video capture and stream with minimal load on the teacher's computer and the network.

The system consists of three components:
- **UNIcast Streamer** - a server application running on the teacher's computer.
- **UNIcast Player** - a client-side display software for the students.
- **H.264 Pro Recorder** - the hardware encoder.
